This is an Advanced Library Management System, developed using Netbeans IDE and MySQL Database.

We have installed the latest versions of Netbeans IDE, Java, MySQL and Xampp server and configured these to set the respective paths with 
consideration of the environment variables.
We have used MySQL database, which is run through the PHPMyAdmin Workbench. It is connected to Java through database connectivity (JDBC).

1) Signup Page for new user registrations.
2) Login Page for returning users.
3) Home Dashboard to select tasks.
4) Manage Books for admin to manage book information and register those into the system.
